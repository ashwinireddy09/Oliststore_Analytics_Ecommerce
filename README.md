# Oliststore_Analytics_Ecommerce
I developed a comprehensive project in Power Bi, creating multiple dashboarda and tables to analyze the data. this process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
## Introduction
The Olist Store Analysis project aims to leverage eCommerce data to derive actionable insights that can enhance business strategies, optimize customer experience, and improve overall sales performance. This project involves detailed analysis and visualization of various aspects of the eCommerce business.

## Problem Statement
The Olist Store Analysis project aims to address the challenges faced by eCommerce businesses in understanding customer behavior, optimizing sales strategies, and improving operational efficiency. With the rapidly growing volume of data generated from various sources such as customer transactions, product reviews, and geolocation information, it becomes crucial for businesses to derive actionable insights from this data. This project focuses on analyzing multiple datasets to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that can inform strategic decisions. By examining patterns in order timings, payment methods, delivery times, and customer reviews, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing sales and customer satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to leverage data analytics to enhance business performance, drive customer engagement, and streamline operations for better overall outcomes.

## Process
Data Understanding - The key to success on any data project is to understand the data in detail. Therefore, we took the time to comprehend the data model and domain of the eCommerce business. This involved familiarizing ourselves with various datasets related to customers, orders, products, sellers, and geographical information.

Data Cleaning - After gaining a thorough understanding of the business and its data, we proceeded to clean the available datasets. This step involved identifying and rectifying any inconsistencies like comments, missing values, and errors in the data. We ensured that the datasets were accurate and prepared for further analysis by standardizing formats and removing duplicates.

Data Modeling - With the cleaned data, we then focused on processing and modeling this data into structured datasets that could effectively answer the business questions. This step involved creating relationships between different datasets, deriving new variables, and aggregating data in a way that facilitated insightful analysis.

Data Analysis - Using the newly modeled dataset, we applied our analytical expertise to uncover meaningful insights. This step involved performing various statistical analyses, identifying patterns and trends, and generating key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business objectives. Additionally, we created visualizations using tools like Tableau to clearly communicate these insights.
